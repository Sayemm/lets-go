- module path as basically being a canonical name or identifier for the project.
- we want to pick a module path that is globally unique and unlikely to be used by anything else.

- Setting up your project as a module has a number of advantages â€” including
making it much easier to manage third-party dependencies, avoid supply-chain attacks,
and ensure reproducible builds of your application in the future.
